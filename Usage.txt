Usage: java <prog name> <args>
where <args> consists of one or more of the following:
    -f, --eventfile <filename>
        Specifies that the list of events is to be read from the specified file.
        This file should be in the standard events.txt form (event = "xxx").
        The filename is relative to the base directory, so "Db\events.txt" will
        usually work.
        Can be used multiple times.
    -e, --extra-events <filename>
        Specifies that events (not a list of event includes) should be read
        from this file.
        Can be used multiple times.
    -x, --text <filename>
        Specifies the language in the localization folder to use.
        The default is English.
    -b, --basedir <directory>
        Specifies that the given directory is the base directory of the FTG
        installation.
        If unspecified, the program will assume it is in the FTG directory.
    -m, --moddir <name>
        Specifies that the given name is the name of a mod in the base directory
        and should be used when possible.
    -o, --output <directory>
        Specifies that output should be placed into the given directory.
        A subdirectory named "eventdoc" will be created to hold the generated
        files other than the index.
        The default value is the current directory.
    -t, --title <format string>
        Specifies to use the given title for the generated files. If the string
        contains %s, this is where the page name is placed.
        The default is "%s -- FTG Event Documentation".
        Note that the % sign is reserved in batch files; %%s is necessary instead.
    --custom-header
        Specifies that custom HTML from the file 'header.htm' will be inserted into
        the end of the header of the generated files.
        Relative links should not be used, because not all generated pages are in the
        same directory.
        Note that this is inserted verbatim, so it should not include <html> or <head>.
    --custom-page-top
        Specifies that custom HTML from the file 'pagetop.htm' will be inserted into
        the generated files (including the index) at the start of the body.
        Note that this is inserted verbatim, so it should not include <html></html>.
    --custom-page-bottom
        Specifies that custom HTML from the file 'pagebottom.htm' will be inserted into
        the generated files (including the index) at the end of the body.
        Note that this is inserted verbatim, so it should not include <html></html>.
    --custom-divider
        Specifies that custom HTML from the file 'betweenevents.htm' will be inserted
        into the generated files between events.
        Note that this is inserted verbatim, so it should not include <html></html>.
        Note also that this might cause layout problems on some browsers.
    --image-dir <directory>
        Specifies that any images will be placed in the given directory (relative to the base).
        The default is to put them in the base directory.
    --css-dir <directory>
        Specifies that the generated files will expect eventdoc.css in the given directory
        (relative to the base) rather than in the base directory.
    --js-dir <directory>
        Specifies that the generated files will expect eventdoc.js in the given directory
        (relative to the base) rather than in the base directory.
    --no-leader-check
        Indicates not to perform any checks of leader commands.
    --no-monarch-check
        Indicates not to perform any checks of monarch commands.
    -h, --help
        Prints this help.
