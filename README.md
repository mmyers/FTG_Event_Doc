### For the Glory Event Documentation Generator

This program parses historical and random events in For the Glory or Europa Universalis II and creates an interlinked set of HTML documention pages like [this](http://crystalempiregames.com/events/eventdoc.htm). This makes it easier to understand event chains like [The Death of Charles the Bold of Burgundy](http://crystalempiregames.com/events/eventdoc/major_bur.txt.htm#evt3597).

It can be configured to generate similar documentation for mods. See Usage.txt or one of the included .bat files.
