Before using, read Usage.txt and edit doc.bat accordingly. Once you have it set
up, it's just a matter of double-clicking the .bat file and waiting for it to
finish.

Note that any paths with spaces will need to be enclosed in "quotation marks".

Note also that the output directory must already exist.
